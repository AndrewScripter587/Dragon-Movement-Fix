# Dragon-Movement-Fix
More basic version of my Old Dragon Mechanics datapack that, though having only one feature and no customizability at all, is **very lightweight** and **supports versions all the way from 19w08b** (1.14 snapshot that introduced MC-272431 that hasn't been fixed since) **to 1.21.4**. While the datapack functions "as intended" on Minecraft versions 1.13 to 19w08a, using it before 19w08b causes the dragon to act very erratically, going uncontrollably up and down for a few seconds until it slows enough to get to the height it wants to be at.
